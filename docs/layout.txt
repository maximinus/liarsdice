Graphical layout values

The screen is 1280 x 960 scaled up or down.

At the top of the screen is navbar.

Underneath that are the players. For 4 players, the layout is as follows:

The 1280 is split into 4 groups. However, we leave a 8 pixel gaps between the players.
That leaves:

	(1280 - (8 * 3)) / 4 = 314 pixels per player.
